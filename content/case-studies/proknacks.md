# Engineering a Premium Digital Presence for American Craftsmanship

We partnered with **Proknacks** to architect a powerful, cohesive digital brand identity and build a high-performance website. The transformation elevated their online presence from a simple digital business card to a lead-generating engine that truly reflects their commitment to precision, quality, and flawless execution for homeowners in Indiana, USA.

## Project Overview

Proknacks is a reputable Indiana-based company known for its exceptional craftsmanship in home improvement and renovation. However, their digital presence did not match the high quality of their physical work, resulting in missed opportunities and a brand image that undersold their expertise.

## The Challenge

### A Disconnected Digital Identity

**Lead & Brand Pain Points:**

- 85% of online inquiries were low-quality or misaligned with their services.
- Website bounce rate of over 70% due to a generic, unengaging user experience.
- Inconsistent branding across the few existing digital touchpoints.
- No effective way to showcase the quality and scope of their completed projects.

**Technology Gaps:**

- A basic, non-interactive website built on an outdated template.
- A single, long contact form with a 15% abandonment rate.
- No mobile-first optimization, leading to a poor experience for 60% of visitors.
- Lack of professional, high-quality visuals and project showcases.

**Business Impact:**

- High cost-per-acquisition for qualified leads.
- Difficulty competing with larger, more digitally-savvy competitors.
- Inability to attract the high-value, large-scale projects they specialize in.
- Brand perception did not reflect their premium craftsmanship.

> _"Our work is top-tier, but our website looked like everyone else's. We were getting calls for minor repairs when we are geared for major renovations. We needed our online 'front door' to reflect the quality inside."_
