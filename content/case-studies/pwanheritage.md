# Elevating Nigeria's Real Estate Experience Through Digital Innovation

We partnered with **Pwan Heritage**, a premier real estate company in Nigeria, to create a digital platform that showcases their luxury properties and exceptional service while enhancing customer engagement and sales conversions.

## Project Overview

Pwan Heritage has been redefining Nigeria's real estate market with high-quality developments across residential, commercial, and mixed-use properties. Despite their impressive portfolio and market presence, their digital platform wasn't effectively converting online interest into sales leads.

## The Challenge

### Digital Barriers in Real Estate

Pwan Heritage faced several digital challenges that hindered their growth:

**Technical Limitations:**

- Outdated property search functionality
- Poor mobile experience (only 35% mobile conversion rate)
- Slow image loading (12+ seconds for property galleries)
- No virtual tour capabilities

**Customer Experience Issues:**

- Difficult property comparison tools
- Lack of neighborhood insights
- No instant chat with agents
- Complex inquiry forms

**Business Impact:**

- High bounce rates (68%)
- Low lead conversion (2.3%)
- Difficulty showcasing property USPs
- Missed opportunities from international buyers

> _"Our beautiful properties weren't getting the digital showcase they deserved. We needed to bridge the gap between our physical excellence and digital presence."_
